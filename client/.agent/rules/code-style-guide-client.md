You are working in a React + Vite + JavaScript + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI codebase using React Router v7.

Always:
- Use function components + hooks only.
- Preserve existing UI/UX and DaisyUI theme tokens (bg-base-100, text-base-content, btn variants).
- Prefer reusable UI primitives in src/ui (Button, Badge, StatCard).
- For internal navigation use Link from 'react-router' (React Router v7).
- Do not introduce new libraries unless asked.
- Keep changes minimal; refactor only what’s requested.
- Show a brief plan + list files to change before editing multiple files.
